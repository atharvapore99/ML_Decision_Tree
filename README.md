## Project Title: Enhancing Classification Accuracy: From College Degree Prediction to Spam Detection Using Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods
## Project Excerpt:

In this project, we delve into the application of decision trees and ensemble learning techniques for various classification problems. We start by constructing a univariate decision tree to predict college degree attainment based on age and salary, and then extend our analysis to multivariate decision trees using linear combinations of these features. We further implement and evaluate Bagging and Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithms with decision trees as base classifiers. Our experiments are conducted on three distinct datasets: college degree prediction, credit risk classification, and email spam detection. Through detailed analysis and error rate plots, we compare the performance and behavior of these methods, exploring their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing classification tasks using advanced decision tree methodologies.
